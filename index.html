    <h2>Professional Experience </h2>

    <h3>DPAA MISA</h3>

    <h4> Enterprise Service Desk (Sept 2023 - Present)</h4>
    <p>Task included the support for IT issues including identifying, tracking, assigning, resolving, 
        and dispositioning tickets. This support may include both customers of the organization as well 
        as internal requests for support. Assisting users in all Nakupuna/DPAA locations online. 
    
    
        <ul>
            <li> I collaborated on locating TS files over JWICs that required the use of SQL and 
                PowerShell to navigate Database servers to locate important files. That had 
                been previously hard to locate, I was able to locate them and put together a form in 
                excel that allowed us to save a lot of money and not have to use someone else’s servers 
                in the process. </li>

            <li>I’m an ACAS operator and have been generating reports, and creating the credentials 
                and although my position is limited. I work alongside DISA/Tenable on anything that 
                was outside of my scope. But I am still the sole ACAS operator for the entire DPAA. 
                I generate the reports Monday and Friday and any issues we have I work alongside DISA 
                and or Netops and Sysadmins to find a fix for the issues we have. </li>
            
            <li>I’m a DIA trusted agent, the only one at DPAA, I assist a small number of users for 
                our JWICs environment. I coordinate with NGA and DIA on any software or hardware request 
                like licenses or TS printer request. I help troubleshoot accounts if they’re any issues 
                that pop up with a user’s account. </li>
