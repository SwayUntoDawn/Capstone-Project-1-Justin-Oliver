    <h2>Cycling</h2>
    <p>Cycling is my favorite way to clear my mind, challenge my body, and stay connected 
        to what matters. I love the rhythm of learning—how each ride teaches me something new, 
        from adjusting tire pressure for smoother terrain to pacing myself over long distances. 
        The Indian Head Rail Trail has become my go-to spot: peaceful, scenic, and just the right  
        mix of effort and escape. Every mile gives me a chance to reset, refocus, and enjoy nature at 
        my own speed. It’s where I’ve really felt my progress, both in fitness and in appreciation for 
        the sport itself.</p>

    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>This has become more than just a way to stay active—it’s grown into a daily ritual that anchors me physically and mentally. What started as a cross-training element for cycling has taken on a rhythm of its own. Whether it’s five miles on lighter days or pushing through ten when I’m feeling strong, 
        lacing up and heading out has become my time to reset, reflect, and refuel my discipline. 
        Each stride feels like a statement, a commitment to growth and grit that carries me forward—not just 
        through the trail or streets, but through everything I tackle in life.</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>One day, I’d love to create my own web manga. 
        The idea of crafting a world—complete with its own rhythm, drama, 
        and heart—and sharing it with others online is something that keeps me fired up. I
         picture blending my drawing style with storytelling that reflects my own experiences and themes I
          care about. It’s not just about art, but connecting with people through characters that feel real 
          and stories that resonate. It might take time, but I’m building the foundation one sketch, one 
          concept, one page at a time.</p>



    <h2>Videogames</h2>

    <p>
        there’s nothing like the sheer scale and polish of a great triple-A game. 
        The Halo series and Destiny are cornerstones of that love: cinematic worlds, rich lore, smooth gunplay, and multiplayer moments that stick with you. Halo’s classic feel and iconic characters made a lasting impression, while Destiny’s evolving universe and co-op grind brought out my competitive side. These games aren’t just visually stunning—they offer tight mechanics and replayability that blend perfectly with social play. Whether it’s
         solo missions or teaming up with others, diving into these worlds feels epic and endlessly rewarding.
